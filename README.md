##  Cash Withdrawal Page Test
- In this project, I automated a withdrawal functionality on a cash withdrawal-like platform. Here are the key highlights: 
●	The script initiates a WebDriver instance and navigates to the application's URL. It then locates the username element and verifies it against the expected username, 'Sarah Williams'. 
●	The script also verifies the initial balance amount displayed on the page against the expected balance of 2000. 
●	The automation process includes locating all four denomination buttons and performing two clicks on each button, followed by verification of the balance amount after each click. 
●	The script concludes by closing the browser window. The project demonstrated proficiency in using Selenium WebDriver for web application testing and verification of dynamic data. 
- Built using **Selenium Webdriver, Java**.

●	The script is designed to count the number of search results and print the count, providing a quick overview of the search effectiveness. 
●	At the end of the process, the script automatically closes the browser, ensuring clean execution. 
●	This project demonstrated my ability to automate web interactions and handle dynamic content using Selenium WebDriver.
